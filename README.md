This is a hobby project I have been working on. Written in Verilog, it uses the DE10-Lite FPGA board to simulate a simple bouncing ball, visualized with the onboard LEDR.
It features:
-Q8.24 Fixed point arithmetic for physics calculations
-Key syncronization for domain crossing
-Hex display
-LED strip visualization
-Edge detection
